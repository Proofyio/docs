<Warning>
    API keys are sensitive and grant access to your account data and email verification services.
    Share them only with trusted sources to safeguard your account. If your key is compromised, [reset](https://my.proofy.io/apps) it in the Proofy admin panel.
</Warning>

Our API supports both single and bulk verification requests.
It's important to understand when to use each option and their limits to ensure accuracy and efficiency.

- **Single** (including JS Widget) -  Should be used for actions like registration, contact and submission forms.
Do not use it to verify emails in lists or databases one by one, as this will result in account suspension.
Use file or batch verification for such tasks.

- **Batch** - Use to verify multiple email databases by sending a single request for efficient batch processing.

- **File** - Use to verify multiple email databases and big files.
Submit all data in a single task for efficient processing and proper deduplication, rather than splitting it into smaller tasks.

- **Webhook** - You can use the verify/single endpoint as a webhook by appending properties as query strings to the URI.
This allows easy integration with CRMs and other tools without extensive programming. To use it, replace the {email} placeholder with the email to verify.
