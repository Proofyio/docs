Our Verification API allows you to verify both Single and Bulk emails.
Proofy API is easy to integrate, cost-effective, fast, and secure.

## Proofy API endpoints
##

- `Single` - Verifies a single email, typically used for form submissions or button clicks.
- `Batch` - Allows sending multiple emails in a single request for efficient batch processing.
- `File` - Used to verify large files containing multiple emails.

Each endpoint provides information on request formats, response structures, and error codes.

Also, we provide a JS Widget that easily integrates into your website to validate email addresses on the fly through a form.
