If you need to verify multiple email addresses at once, you can use our Batch Email Verification API.

Proofy's distributed infrastructure ensures optimal results and will retry any verifications if necessary.

Submit an array of email addresses, optionally including names.

The response data will include the names provided, which can also be used to pass your internal ID.

### Batch size recommendation

Single batch can process up to 200 emails

This method is recommended when verification quality is a priority, as it offers the highest accuracy in email validation and the fewest "unknown" results.
