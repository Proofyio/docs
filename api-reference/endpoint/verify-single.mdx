You can utilize Proofy's Real-time Email Verification API to validate email addresses as they are entered, and incorporate it into your sign-up forms.

This comprehensive email verification and validation method not only checks the syntax and domain of the address but also communicates with underlying SMTP servers to confirm email deliverability.

Proofy will provide the best possible results within 10 seconds.

### Rate Limiting

The Real-Time Email Verification API is limited to 1000 requests per minute by default.
