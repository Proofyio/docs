The file creation endpoint allows you to verify multiple emails at once by creating a task to process the file asynchronously.
Verification results are not included in the response.

### File upload recommendation

For efficiency and deduplication, submit data in a single task rather than splitting it.
For example, submit one file with 50k emails instead of 10 files of 5k each. If using data from a CRM, buffer it locally before submission.

### Size limiting
The Bulk API supports files up to 65 MB.
